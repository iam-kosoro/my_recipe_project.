        <h3>Preparations</h3>
            <p>Sort fresh vegetables and wash clean.</p>
            <p>Cut vegetables into small crafty chunks.</p>
            <p>I advice you cut in bits -<strong><em>Well it doesn't matter as long as you just chop the damn thing ...LOL</em></strong></p>
            <p>Put the vegetables in the fridge to chill in waiting.</p>
            <p>Sieve off the water in the green beans and pour it in a big prep bowl.</p>
            <p>Follow up with the rest of the tin food in the same bowl as the green beans</p>
            <p>In another bowl mix in the mayonnaise and remia 6tsp to 1 respectively. <strong>Mutiply in this pattern according to quantity.</strong> Keep to chill.</p>
            <p>Cook chicken for 20 minutes. I advice you marinate the night before - You may want to use kitchen glory, cory powder, knorr, salt, bay leaves, garlic etc</p>
            <p>Fry in shallow vegetable oil till it's evenly brown.</p>
            <p>Slice chicken and put in bowl.</p>
            <p><strong>Here comes the magic!</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix the vegetables and the chicken together.</li>
                <li>Pour in the salad dressing mixture and turn vigorously.</li>
                <li>Turn till you have a perfect mixture of all ingredients.</li>
            </ol>
        <p>As always serve chilled and you'd better spare some because you'll be needing it later.</p>
